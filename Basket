Claire, Angel, and Gavi's CPI 
    textbooks.25 + food.35 + transportation.04 + hygiene.1 + rent.25 +
Justification: textbooks are expensive and we need new ones every semester
               food is needed to live - need most often
               transportation - needed sometimes, mostly provided by tuition 
               hygiene - also needed, not necessary to boy as often as food
               rent - needed to live, very expensive with utlitiies and whatnot
