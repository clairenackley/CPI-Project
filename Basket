               hygiene * commodities minus food * (SA0L1E) - also needed, not necessary to boy as often as food
               rent(SASR2S) - needed to live, very expensive with utlitiies and whatnot
               clothes no shoes(SA311) are enecessary - but we don't have time or funds to go shopping very often
