Claire, Angel, and Gavi's CPI 
    textbooks.25 + food.25 + transportation.04 + hygiene.1 + rent.15 + apparel.03 + entertainment.08 +medicalservices.1
Justification: textbooks are expensive and we need new ones every semester
               food is needed to live - need most often
               transportation - needed sometimes, mostly provided by tuition 
               hygiene - also needed, not necessary to boy as often as food
               rent - needed to live, very expensive with utlitiies and whatnot
               clothes are enecessary - but we don't have time or funds to go shopping very often
               entertainment - takes a decent amount of the funds because college students try to have as much fun as possible (drinking, partying, streaming services, gaming)
               medical services - a necessity, tends to be expensive, people get sick in college a lot
